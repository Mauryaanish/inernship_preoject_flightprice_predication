## About Project
A flight price prediction project aims to forecast the prices of airline tickets, allowing travelers to make informed decisions about their travel plans. By analyzing historical flight data, current market trends, and various factors that influence ticket prices, such as seasonality, demand, and availability, the project seeks to provide accurate predictions of future flight prices

## Project Pipeline

### :- Data ingestion
In the Ingestion Process, we will convert our original dataset which is in Zip format to csv format. After that we will split them into train and test dataset.

### :- Data Validation 
In Data validation steps we could use Null value handling, outlier handling, Imbalanced data set handling, Handling columns with standard deviation zero or below a threshold, etc.

### :- Data Transformation
In this step we will transform out data. We will use standard scaler for numeric data and we will convert categorical data into numeric data using label encoding technique so that machine can understand it.

### :- Model Building 
Here we will build the Machine Learning model using all regression algorithms

### :- Model Evaluation
Here model evaluation will be done on the model which we got in the model building stage. We can define base accuracy of the model and if model accuracy is higher then base accuracy, then only our model will accept otherwise it will be rejected.

### :- Model Deployment 
Here the model is deployed to the Azure cloud platform.
